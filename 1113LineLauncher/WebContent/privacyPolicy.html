			<li>We reserve the right to modify or terminate the Service or
				your access to the Service for any reason, without notice, at any
				time, and without liability to you. You can deactivate your
				line launcher account by logging into the Service and completing the
				form available here: <a
				href="https://line launcher.com/accounts/remove/request/">https://line launcher.com/accounts/remove/request/</a>.
				If we terminate your access to the Service or you use the form
				detailed above to deactivate your account, your photos, comments,
				likes, friendships, and all other data will no longer be accessible
				through your account (e.g., users will not be able to navigate to
				your username and view your photos), but those materials and data
				may persist and appear within the Service (e.g., if your Content has
				been reshared by others).
			</li>
			<li>Upon termination, all licenses and other rights granted to
				you in these Terms of Use will immediately cease.</li>
			<li>We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to change
				these Terms of Use (<strong>"Updated Terms"</strong>) from time to
				time. Unless we make a change for legal or administrative reasons,
				we will provide reasonable advance notice before the Updated Terms
				become effective. You agree that we may notify you of the Updated
				Terms by posting them on the Service, and that your use of the
				Service after the effective date of the Updated Terms (or engaging
				in such other conduct as we may reasonably specify) constitutes your
				agreement to the Updated Terms. Therefore, you should review these
				Terms of Use and any Updated Terms before using the Service. The
				Updated Terms will be effective as of the time of posting, or such
				later date as may be specified in the Updated Terms, and will apply
				to your use of the Service from that point forward. These Terms of
				Use will govern any disputes arising before the effective date of
				the Updated Terms.
			</li>
			<li>We reserve the right to refuse access to the Service to
				anyone for any reason at any time.</li>
			<li>We reserve the right to force forfeiture of any username for

				users of the Service, whether online or offline. You agree that
				line launcher is not responsible or liable for the conduct of any user.
				line launcher reserves the right, but has no obligation, to monitor or

				common sense and your best judgment when interacting with others,
				including when you submit or post Content or any personal or other
				information.</li>
			<li>There may be links from the Service, or from communications
				you receive from the Service, to third-party web sites or features.
				There may also be links to third-party web sites or features in
				images or comments within the Service. The Service also includes
				third-party content that we do not control, maintain or endorse.
				Functionality on the Service may also permit interactions between
				the Service and a third-party web site or feature, including
				applications that connect the Service or your profile on the Service
				with a third-party web site or feature. For example, the Service may
				include a feature that enables you to share Content from the Service
				or your Content with a third party, which may be publicly posted on
				that third party's service or application. Using this functionality
				typically requires you to login to your account on the third-party
				service and you do so at your own risk. line launcher does not control
				any of these third-party web services or any of their content. You
				expressly acknowledge and agree that line launcher is in no way
				responsible or liable for any such third-party services or features.
				YOUR CORRESPONDENCE AND BUSINESS DEALINGS WITH THIRD PARTIES FOUND
				THROUGH THE SERVICE ARE SOLELY BETWEEN YOU AND THE THIRD PARTY. You
				may choose, at your sole and absolute discretion and risk, to use
				applications that connect the Service or your profile on the Service
				with a third-party service (each, an "Application") and such
				Application may interact with, connect to or gather and/or pull
				information from and to your Service profile. By using such
				Applications, you acknowledge and agree to the following: (i) if you
				use an Application to share information, you are consenting to
				information about your profile on the Service being shared; (ii)
				your use of an Application may cause personally identifying
				information to be publicly disclosed and/or associated with you,
				even if line launcher has not itself provided such information; and
				(iii) your use of an Application is at your own option and risk, and
				you will hold the line launcher Parties (defined below) harmless for
				activity related to the Application.</li>
			<li>You agree that you are responsible for all data charges you
				incur through use of the Service.</li>
			<li>We prohibit crawling, scraping, caching or otherwise
				accessing any content on the Service via automated means, including
				but not limited to, user profiles and photos (except as may be the
				result of standard search engine protocols or technologies used by a
				search engine with line launcher's express consent).</li>
		</ol>
		<h2 id="rights">Rights</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>line launcher does not claim ownership of any Content that you
				post on or through the Service. Instead, you hereby grant to

				transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide license to use the Content
				that you post on or through the Service, subject to the Service's
				Privacy Policy, available here <a

			<li>Although it is line launcher's intention for the Service to be
				available as much as possible, there will be occasions when the
				Service may be interrupted, including, without limitation, for
				scheduled maintenance or upgrades, for emergency repairs, or due to
				failure of telecommunications links and/or equipment. Also,
				line launcher reserves the right to remove any Content from the Service
				for any reason, without prior notice. Content removed from the
				Service may continue to be stored by line launcher, including, without
				limitation, in order to comply with certain legal obligations, but
				may not be retrievable without a valid court order. Consequently,
				line launcher encourages you to maintain your own backup of your
				Content. In other words, line launcher is not a backup service and you
				agree that you will not rely on the Service for the purposes of
				Content backup or storage. line launcher will not be liable to you for
				any modification, suspension, or discontinuation of the Services, or
				the loss of any Content. You also acknowledge that the Internet may
				be subject to breaches of security and that the submission of
				Content or other information may not be secure.</li>
			<li>You agree that line launcher is not responsible for, and does
				not endorse, Content posted within the Service. line launcher does not
				have any obligation to prescreen, monitor, edit, or remove any
				Content. If your Content violates these Terms of Use, you may bear
				legal responsibility for that Content.</li>
			<li>Except as otherwise described in the Service's Privacy
				Policy, available at http://line launcher.com/legal/privacy/, as between
				you and line launcher, any Content will be non-confidential and
				non-proprietary and we will not be liable for any use or disclosure
				of Content. You acknowledge and agree that your relationship with
				line launcher is not a confidential, fiduciary, or other type of special
				relationship, and that your decision to submit any Content does not
				place line launcher in a position that is any different from the
				position held by members of the general public, including with
				regard to your Content. None of your Content will be subject to any
				obligation of confidence on the part of line launcher, and line launcher
				will not be liable for any use or disclosure of any Content you
				provide.</li>
			<li>It is line launcher's policy not to accept or consider content,
				information, ideas, suggestions or other materials other than those
				we have specifically requested and to which certain specific terms,
				conditions and requirements may apply. This is to avoid any
				misunderstandings if your ideas are similar to those we have
				developed or are developing independently. Accordingly, line launcher
				does not accept unsolicited materials or ideas, and takes no
				responsibility for any materials or ideas so transmitted. If,
				despite our policy, you choose to send us content, information,
				ideas, suggestions, or other materials, you further agree that
				line launcher is free to use any such content, information, ideas,
				suggestions or other materials, for any purposes whatsoever,
				including, without limitation, developing and marketing products and

			arbitration for any claims covered by this agreement. You also agree
			not to participate in claims brought in a private attorney general or
			representative capacity, or consolidated claims involving another
			person's account, if line launcher is a party to the proceeding. This
			dispute resolution provision will be governed by the Federal
			Arbitration Act. In the event the American Arbitration Association is
			unwilling or unable to set a hearing date within one hundred and
			sixty (160) days of filing the case, then either line launcher or you can
			elect to have the arbitration administered instead by the Judicial
			Arbitration and Mediation Services. Judgment on the award rendered by

			awards that conflict with these Terms of Use.</p>
		<p>You may opt out of this agreement to arbitrate. If you do so,
			neither you nor line launcher can require the other to participate in an
			arbitration proceeding. To opt out, you must notify line launcher in
			writing within 30 days of the date that you first became subject to
			this arbitration provision. You must use this address to opt out:</p>
		<p>line launcher, LLC ATTN: Arbitration Opt-out 1601 Willow Rd. Menlo
			Park, CA 94025</p>
		<p>You must include your name and residence address, the email
			address you use for your line launcher account, and a clear statement
			that you want to opt out of this arbitration agreement.</p>
		<p>If the prohibition against class actions and other claims
			brought on behalf of third parties contained above is found to be
			unenforceable, then all of the preceding language in this Arbitration
			section will be null and void. This arbitration agreement will
			survive the termination of your relationship with line launcher.</p>
		<h2 id="time-limitation-on-claims">Time Limitation on Claims</h2>

			litigating all such disputes.</p>
		<p>If any provision of these Terms of Use is held to be unlawful,

			and enforceability of any remaining provisions. line launcher's failure
			to insist upon or enforce strict performance of any provision of

			right. No waiver of any of these Terms will be deemed a further or
			continuing waiver of such term or condition or any other term or
			condition. line launcher reserves the right to change this dispute
			resolution provision, but any such changes will not apply to disputes

			resolution provision will survive the termination of any or all of
